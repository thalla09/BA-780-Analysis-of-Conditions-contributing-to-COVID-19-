Aim is to assess the regions and demographic age groups most susceptible to COVID-19-related mortality, allowing us to strategically allocate our vaccination resources to target these high-risk areas. This is done due to the countless people who suffered from this disease and we aim to help organizations better understand this data to make better public health decisions.

Data source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Link to access the data source is provided below. https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku

Each row represents a time period (months/years) when deaths occured and tells us whether those deaths were from COVID-19, Influenza, Pneumonia, or any other reason.
